# Demo Sample Pack — Provenance / Licensing

Demo assets referenced by demo jobs are intended to be **license-safe**.

If you generate local demo videos, use FFmpeg built-in test sources (e.g., `testsrc`, `testsrc2`, `smptebars`, `color`).
These outputs are synthetic and may be redistributed.

No privately sourced or third-party reference videos are included in this repository.
